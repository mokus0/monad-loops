{-# LANGUAGE CPP #-}

-- |A collection of loop operators for use in monads (mostly in stateful ones).
-- 
-- There is a general naming pattern for many of these:
-- Functions with names ending in _ discard the results of the loop body
-- as in the standard Prelude 'mapM' functions.
-- 
-- Functions with names ending in ' collect their results into 'MonadPlus'
-- containers.  Note that any short-circuit effect that those types' 
-- 'MonadPlus' instances may provide in a lazy context (such as the instance
-- for 'Maybe') will _not_ cause execution to short-circuit in these loops.
--
-- Functions with names ending in neither of those will generally return
-- just plain old lists.
